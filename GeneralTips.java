/* HERE ARE SOME GENERAL TIPS IF YOU GET STUCK IN THE CONTEST!
    
    - Think about pre-computation if possible
    - Think about solving a problem in reverse (e.g., 8-puzzle on CHATGPT #2 contest)
    - Check input size:
        - Smaller input size: brute force
        - Medium to large input size: may use graph algorithms or dynamic programming (DP)
        - Very large input size: greedy or binary search
    - Recognizing keywords:
        - “Optimal”, “minimum”, “maximum”:
            - Likely DP or greedy
        - “Path”, “node”, “part”, “component”:
            - Likely graph algorithms
        - “Match”, “link”:
            - Likely network flow
        - “String”, “word”, “prefix”, “suffix”:
            - Likely trie or string algorithms
        - “Subset”, “arrangements”, “order”, “counting”:
            - Likely permutations (brute force or DP)
    - If stuck, try to work out test cases and draw out the problem.
    - READ THE PROBLEM CAREFULLY for bounds and any hidden rules.
    - **Important**: Understand edge cases! 
        - For example, input can include negative values, 0, or even very large values.
    - **Take advantage of time limits**:
        - Some problems can be solved in O(n) or O(n log n) even though it seems you may need O(n^2).
    - **Don’t panic**: If stuck, move to another problem and come back after clearing your mind.
    - **Debugging**:
        - Write a small helper function to check if your solution is close to expected outputs.
        - Use print statements or online debugging tools.
    - **Plan**:
        - Read through the entire problem once first, then break it down into parts.
        - If you don’t know where to start, look for patterns or start with a brute force solution and optimize it later.
    - **Efficiency**:
        - Always remember to check the time complexity of your solution. Avoid O(n^2) or worse if the input size is large.
    - **Mathy Problems**:
        - Make sure to handle large numbers properly (use long or BigInteger when necessary).
        - Practice modular arithmetic when dealing with large numbers in combinatorics or DP.
